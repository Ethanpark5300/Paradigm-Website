                                Jill Abernathy is a Family Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner. She
                                graduated from Walden University with her Masters of Advanced Nursing Practice
                                and is board certified through the American Nurses Credentialing Center. Jill
                                works with patients across the lifespan and has extensive experience working
                                with children and adolescents in the mental health field. While Jill’s mental
                                health expertise allows her to treat symptoms during visits, her true passion
                                lies in uncovering root issues. By addressing deeper causes of mental health
                                issues, clients are able to more fully embrace their authentic selves. Over the
                                years, Jill has gained experience working in diverse settings, including:
                                inpatient psychiatric hospitals, intensive outpatient substance abuse programs,
                                assertive community treatment (ACT), and crisis intervention. Jill has dedicated
                                her career to helping people see their potential by encouraging positive change
                                in her patients. Through therapeutic practice that combines medication
                                management with alternative modalities such as yoga, breath-work, and
                                mindfulness, Jill believes clients have better outcomes. She focuses on treating
                                patients holistically by creating an environment that reduces stigma and allows
                                patients to tailor their goals through individualized treatment plans. In
                                addition to her professional experience, in her personal life, Jill enjoys
                                learning and utilizing alternative therapies including practicing yoga regularly
                                in order to stay grounded. She loves adventure travel, scuba diving, being in
                                nature, and spending time with her family. She truly has a passion for helping
                                others to become their best selves.
