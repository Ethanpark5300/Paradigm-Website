                                    <p> During a psychiatric evaluation, the mental health provider gathers information
                                        through various methods, such as diagnostic interview, questionnaire screenings
                                        and standardized assessments. They explore the individual's medical history,
                                        personal and social history, family history, current symptoms, past trauma, and
                                        relevant life events. The provider will ask questions to obtain information
                                        about active and past symptoms, duration, and severity to determine an accurate
                                        diagnosis and treatment plan.
                                    </p>

                                    <p> A Psychiatric Evaluation takes approximately 60 minutes. Your provider may also
                                        decide to order other testing, such as blood work to look at the overall health
                                        of the patient and rule out any underlying issues that may be contributing to a
                                        decline in mental health.

                                    <p> Psychiatric medication management is the process of working with your mental
                                        health provider to ensure that your psychiatric medications are effective and
                                        safe. This may include changing doses, switching medications, or adding new
                                        drugs. Medication management can significantly reduce symptoms and help people
                                        focus on their recovery. In fact, proper medication management can make the
                                        difference in someone keeping close relationships, staying healthy, keeping a
                                        job, and avoiding trouble.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p> The same prescription drug can affect one person differently than it affects
                                        another person. Our providers thoroughly discuss expectations, potential side
                                        effects that can occur and different options that are available, while
                                        considering cost-effectiveness. We also help patients discontinue and safely
                                        taper off medications that are no longer needed, effective or beneficial to
                                        their health.

                                    <p> Medication management appointments can vary in frequency from weekly to every
                                        1-3 months depending on the type of medication, diagnosis, and severity of
                                        symptoms. Most refills are done during the follow up appointments.

                                        time-consuming and debilitating. The GeneSight® Test analyzes how your genes may
                                        respond to and metabolize medications. A simple cheek swab is done to collect a
                                        saliva sample and sent out to a laboratory. Results come back in 3-5 business
                                        days. </p>

                                        be less likely to work, or have an increased risk of side effects based on the
