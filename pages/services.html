                                    <p> During a psychiatric evaluation, the mental health provider gathers information
                                        through various methods, such as diagnostic interview, questionnaire screenings
                                        and standardized assessments. They explore the individual's medical history,
                                        personal and social history, family history, current symptoms, past trauma, and
                                        relevant life events. The provider will ask questions to obtain information
                                        about active and past symptoms, duration, and severity to determine an accurate
                                        diagnosis and treatment plan.
                                    </p>

                                    <p> A Psychiatric Evaluation takes approximately 60 minutes. Your provider may also
                                        decide to order other testing, such as blood work to look at the overall health
                                        of the patient and rule out any underlying issues that may be contributing to a
                                        decline in mental health.

                                    <p> Psychiatric medication management is the process of working with your mental
                                        health provider to ensure that your psychiatric medications are effective and
                                        safe. This may include changing doses, switching medications, or adding new
                                        drugs. Medication management can significantly reduce symptoms and help people
                                        focus on their recovery. In fact, proper medication management can make the
                                        difference in someone keeping close relationships, staying healthy, keeping a
                                        job, and avoiding trouble.
                                    </p>

                                    <p> The same prescription drug can affect one person differently than it affects
                                        another person. Our providers thoroughly discuss expectations, potential side
                                        effects that can occur and different options that are available, while
                                        considering cost-effectiveness. We also help patients discontinue and safely
                                        taper off medications that are no longer needed, effective or beneficial to
                                        their health.

                                        symptoms. Most refills are done during the follow up appointments.

                                        saliva sample and sent out to a laboratory. Results come back in 3-5 business

                                    <p> QbTest is an FDA-approved and widely used objective ADHD test that measures core
                                        ADHD symptoms: activity, attention, and impulsivity. The test can be done on
                                        ages 6 – 60 years old. The standardized test is backed by years of research and
                                        is to be used alongsid other clinical measures and cognitive tests. It can rule
                                        in or rule out the disorder and measure a patient’s response to treatment with a
                                        follow up re-test.

                                    <p> The test involves a 15-20 minute computer-based test. The results are instantly
                                        generated, presented in a report, and compared with data from other people of
                                        the same age who do not have ADHD. Your rovider will analyze, interpret, and
                                        discuss the results with you during your appointment. Depending on the
                                        individual’s results, the provider will develop a treatment plan that can
                                        include prescription medication or alternative therapies. Testing is also
                                        beneficial for students that may require specific school accommodations.

                                    <p> Psychotherapy explores thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and seeks to improve
                                        an individual's well-being. Psychotherapy paired with medication management is
                                        the most effective way to promote recovery. We try to incorporate anywhere from
                                        10 to 20 minutes of psychotherapy into each session. It is a necessary component
                                        in addition to the medication management portion to determine underlying issues
                                        and the root causes of certain mental health issues. However, more extensive
                                        therapy sessions may be recommended. Paradigm Psychiatry works closely with many
                                        Psychologists, Therapists, and Counselors in the community and can provide a
                                        referral for Psychotherapy, EMDR, DBT, & CBT. We will coordinate with your other
                                        mental health providers to achieve more effective care.
